This is a practive project to use AWS Amplify for fast development and deploying.
Also used Material UI.
Amplify is a usful tool to develop and host quickly but also require some learning.
It also has several bugs that cause lots of wasteful time/effort.
I would recommend to use this if you are willing to spend some time to learn to use it properly.
Once you are familiar, it should be a good tool to have.


The app is keep track of expense.
User can enter an expense and it is recorded in Amplify Dynamo DB.
Budget is set at 1000 in the begining.  User can change the budget.
Each expense can be removed.  Or all expenses are removed by clicking 'Reset Expense'


- NewForm1.jsx - created by Amplify.  execute create fetch automatically.
- ExpenseList - use DataGrid by MUI.
- used amplify created component ExpenseCreateForm.  can use props to handle what to do when 'submit' is clicked, ie 'onSuccess'
- about changing budget.  user can change budget and that needs to be saved in DB.  however, could not find query only the latest budget from DB.  so, when budget is changed, all entry in budget table is deleted and new budget is saved.  so the first data from query is the valid budget



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
